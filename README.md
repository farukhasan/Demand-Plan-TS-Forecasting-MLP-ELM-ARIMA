# Demand-Plan-TS-Forecasting-MLP-ELM-ARIMA

## Overview

This document outlines the methodology for implementing a comprehensive demand forecasting system using four distinct approaches: Time Series Analysis (ARIMA), Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), Extreme Learning Machine (ELM), and traditional statistical methods.

## Data Generation and Preparation

### Synthetic Data Creation

The model generates synthetic demand data that incorporates realistic business patterns:

**Trend Component**: Linear growth pattern representing long-term demand evolution
**Seasonal Patterns**: 
- Weekly seasonality (7-day cycle)
- Monthly seasonality (30-day cycle) 
- Yearly seasonality (365-day cycle)

**External Factors**:
- Temperature variations
- Promotional activities (10% probability)
- Holiday effects (5% probability)
- Special events with demand spikes

**Noise Components**: Random variations to simulate real-world uncertainty

### Feature Engineering

The system creates multiple feature types to capture different aspects of demand patterns:

**Lag Features**: Historical demand values at 1, 7, and 30-day intervals
**Moving Averages**: Rolling averages over 7 and 30-day windows
**Temporal Features**: Day of week, month, day of year
**External Variables**: Temperature, promotions, holidays

## Model Implementations

### 1. ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)

**Purpose**: Traditional time series forecasting using statistical methods

**Implementation Steps**:
1. Stationarity testing using Augmented Dickey-Fuller test
2. Parameter selection using (p,d,q) order specification
3. Model fitting using maximum likelihood estimation
4. Residual analysis and model validation

**Key Parameters**:
- p: Number of autoregressive terms
- d: Degree of differencing
- q: Number of moving average terms

**Advantages**: Well-established statistical foundation, handles trend and seasonality
**Limitations**: Requires stationary data, limited handling of external factors

### 2. Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)

**Purpose**: Neural network approach for capturing complex non-linear relationships

**Architecture**:
- Input layer: All engineered features
- Hidden layers: 100, 50, 25 neurons respectively
- Output layer: Single neuron for demand prediction
- Activation function: ReLU for hidden layers, linear for output

**Training Process**:
1. Feature standardization using StandardScaler
2. Network initialization with random weights
3. Backpropagation training using Adam optimizer
4. Early stopping to prevent overfitting

**Hyperparameters**:
- Learning rate: Adaptive (Adam optimizer)
- Maximum iterations: 1000
- Batch processing: Full dataset

### 3. Extreme Learning Machine (ELM)

**Purpose**: Fast learning algorithm for single hidden layer neural networks

**Implementation Details**:
1. Random initialization of input weights and biases
2. Hidden layer output computation using tanh activation
3. Output weight calculation using Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse
4. Single-pass training without iterative optimization

**Mathematical Foundation**:
- Hidden layer output: H = tanh(XW + b)
- Output weights: β = H⁺Y (where H⁺ is pseudoinverse)
- Final prediction: Y = Hβ

**Advantages**: Extremely fast training, good generalization
**Limitations**: No weight optimization, performance depends on random initialization

### 4. Time Series Analysis

**Purpose**: Comprehensive statistical analysis of temporal patterns

**Components**:
- Trend decomposition
- Seasonal pattern identification
- Correlation analysis
- Stationarity assessment

**Methodology**:
1. Data visualization and pattern recognition
2. Autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation analysis
3. Seasonal decomposition
4. Statistical significance testing

## Model Evaluation Framework

### Performance Metrics

**Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: Average absolute difference between predicted and actual values
**Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)**: Square root of mean squared errors, penalizes large errors
**R-squared (R²)**: Proportion of variance explained by the model

### Validation Strategy

**Training/Testing Split**: 80/20 split maintaining temporal order
**Time Series Validation**: No random shuffling to preserve temporal dependencies
**Cross-validation**: Time series cross-validation for robust performance assessment

### Comparison Methodology

1. Train all models on identical training datasets
2. Evaluate performance on same test set
3. Compare metrics across all approaches
4. Identify best-performing model based on MAE

## Implementation Workflow

### Phase 1: Data Preparation

4. Split data into training and testing sets

### Phase 2: Model Training

2. Train MLP with feature scaling and regularization
3. Train ELM with random weight initialization
4. Validate all models using consistent metrics

### Phase 3: Evaluation and Selection
1. Calculate performance metrics for each model
2. Generate prediction visualizations
3. Compare model performance systematically
4. Select best model based on evaluation criteria

### Phase 4: Forecasting
1. Generate future predictions using selected model
2. Create confidence intervals where applicable
3. Visualize forecast results
4. Export predictions for business use
